<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>

Hi, I’m a Web Designer based in Johannesburg, South Africa. I specialize in creating clean, modern, and user-focused digital experiences that bring ideas to life. My passion extends beyond design — I’m deeply inspired by Artificial Intelligence and the Fourth Industrial Revolution (4IR), and I love exploring how these technologies can shape the future of design and human interaction online.</p>

<p>I believe that great design is about more than just visuals — it’s about building connections, solving problems, and creating digital experiences that make an impact. Whether I’m designing a sleek portfolio site or integrating cutting-edge AI tools, I’m driven by curiosity, creativity, and innovation</p>
